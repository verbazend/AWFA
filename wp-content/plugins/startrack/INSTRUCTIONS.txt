StarTrack Express Shipping Plugin
Developed by Alex Kebbell | Version 1.3
=========================================================================

This WooCommerce Shipping Plugin uses StarTrack Express eServices to calculate the shipping cost estimate. It requires that your store uses Australian Dollars (AUD) for its currency and that your store's base country is Australia.

Delivery estimates are not yet a function of this plugin, but available upon request (email support).

When setting up the extension it needs to Calculate the shipping on the Checkout Page. Not the Cart page. Please disable the function in WooCommerce to calculate the shipping on the cart page.Go to woocommerce/settings/shipping: untick or do not tick the option to calculate shipping on the cart page.
